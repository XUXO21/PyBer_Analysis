Total Fare Trend

![Graph](/analysis/tGraph.png)

* Urban: Is the most important Revenue generator since it has the bigest scale of our type of cities, is important to take un count that the lowest Fare per Ride and per driver. Regarding fares through the early months of 2019, we can see that on January the trend begins to increase having two peaks at the begining and end of the month, on late Feb it also increases in the same proportion of other type of cities. Also in march we have two peaks with mirror falls, finally by april trens falls, thing that only happens on urban cities. 
* Suburban: is the second most important in terms of revenue, rides and drivers. It has an average fare per driver significantly higher than Urban (+138 p.p.) while in the per ride is only +26 p.p. higer. Seasonality in general is pretty similiar to the rest just having a bigger peak on late Febrary vs rural or urban, also starting on april trend slows and falls at the begingin of the month but it regains positive trend on the second half of the month. 
* Rural: The smallest one in total reevenue generation, the highest fare per ride and per driver of all. On January to february we can see two peaks followed by a fall at the firs three weeks of the month followd by late February peak, as all the citties. On the begining of April we can see as Urban that trends falls.

## Summary:

On summary we can tell that Urban is the most affordable kind of fare in comparison with the others, eventhough it has the 81% of the total Drivers it only represents the 63% of the total fare generation and the 68% of Total Rides. Fare por ride is -18% lower than total average and Fare per dirver is -55% lower than total per Driver average. While Suburban is also affordable for our riders, since the fare is only 3% above total average per ride, still above Urban by 26%. Our drivers also have an atractive Fare being 6% above total Fare per Dirver average and +138% over the Urban. With the 16% of the Drivers, suburban generates the 26% of the rides and the 30% of the fares. Rural citites are the leas afforsable for riders, but the difference vs Total Average Fares per Ride is of 15%, while per driver is 40% additional vs average, for that reason this kind of city is the most profitable for our riders. With obly the 3% of riders it generates the 5% of total Rides and the 7% of total fares.
